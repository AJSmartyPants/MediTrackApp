# MediTrack: The Antidote to Knowing Your Medicines!

Have you ever dealt with owning a medicine and not remembering its purpose? Now consider people who live alone with lots on their plate, who forget to monitor their medicines. Think about the **131 million people in the United States** alone who use prescription drugs. And think about the **35% of the population over 50 years old**, of whom **75% take medicine** and **27% live alone**. Studies show that **50% of people struggle with taking, remembering, and understanding their medications**.

Not managing your medications can lead to **disorganization** and discourage adherence to prescriptions. More importantly, it can result in **worsening of ailments** and **unnecessary medical waste or expenses**, as you might buy duplicates or alternatives to medicine you already have.
